## Features
- Faster Search **O(logN)** Complexity.
- High Accurate Output Result.
- Best for Implimenting on python based web application or APIs.
- Best implementation for College students and freshers for project creation.

## Installation

This library is compatible for both *windows* and *Linux system* you can just use **PIP command** to install this library on your system:

```shell
pip install DeepImageSearch
```

If you are facing any VS C++ 14 related issue in windows during installation, kindly refer to following solution: [Pip error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44951456/pip-error-microsoft-visual-c-14-0-is-required "Pip error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required")

## How To Use?

We have provided **Demo** folder under the *github repository*, you can find the example in the both **.py** and **.ipynb**  file. Following are the idel flow of the code:

#### 1. Importing the Importent Classes
There are three importent classes you need to load **LoadData** - for data loading, **Index** - for indexing the images to database/folder, **SearchImage** - For searching and Ploting the images

```python
# Importing the proper classes
from DeepImageSearch import Index,LoadData,SerachImage
```

#### 2. Loading the Images Data

For loading the images data we need to use **LoadData** object, from there we can import images from CSV file and from Single/Multiple Folders.

```python
# load the Images from the Folder (You can also import data from multiple folder in python list type)
image_list = LoadData.from_folder(['images','wiki-images'])

# Load data from CSV file
image_list = LoadData.from_csv(csv_file_path='your_csv_file.csv',images_column_name='column_name)
```
### 3. Indexing and Saving The File in Local Folder

For faster retrival we are using tree based indexing techniques for Images features, So for that we need to store meta information on the local path **[meta-data-files/]** folder.

```python
# For Faster Serching we need to index Data first, After Indexing all the meta data stored on the local path
Index(image_list).Start()
```
### 3. Searching

Saerching operation are performed by following method:
```python
# for searching you need to give the image path and the number of similar image you want
SerachImage.get_similar_images(image_path=image_list[0],number_of_images=5)
```
you can also plot some similar images for viewving purpose by following code method:
```python
# If you want to plot similar images the you can use this method, It will plot 16 most similar images from the data index
SerachImage.plot_similar_images(image_path = image_list[0])
```

## Complete Code

```python
# Importing the proper classes
from DeepImageSearch import Index,LoadData,SerachImage

# load the Images from the Folder (You can also import data from multiple folder in python list type)
image_list = LoadData.from_folder(['images','wiki-images'])

# For Faster Serching we need to index Data first, After Indexing all the meta data stored on the local path
Index(image_list).Start()

# for searching you need to give the image path and the number of similar image you want
SerachImage.get_similar_images(image_path=image_list[0],number_of_images=5)

# If you want to plot similar images the you can use this method, It will plot 16 most similar images from the data index
SerachImage.plot_similar_images(image_path = image_list[0])


```
